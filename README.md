# Monte-Carlo-Path-Integral
Monte Carlo approach to generate path configurations with Metropolis-Hastings method and measure observables and 2-point correlations functions for each path. these qantities are statistically averaged for many stochastic paths. Implemented with the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator lagrangian intially and expected to be applied to a scalar field theory.
